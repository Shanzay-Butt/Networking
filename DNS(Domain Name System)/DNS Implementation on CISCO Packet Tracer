The Domain Name System (DNS) is the internet’s directory service that translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses 
that computers use to identify each other on networks.Think of DNS as the “phonebook of the internet.”

 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 🌍 Importance of DNS >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. Without DNS, the internet would be extremely hard to use—everyone would need to memorize IPs.
2. Modern DNS services provide malware blocking, phishing protection, and encryption.
3. Allows billions of devices and websites to interact seamlessly.
4. Email, cloud apps, e-commerce, streaming—all rely on DNS.


<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ⭐ Pros of DNS >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. Users can type simple names instead of long numeric IP addresses.
2. Designed to handle billions of domain lookups every day across the world.
3. DNS caching speeds up repeated visits to websites.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ⚠️ Cons of DNS >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, and DDoS attacks can disrupt service.
2. If DNS fails (locally or globally), users cannot access websites—even if servers are online.
3. Large organizations require careful DNS management to avoid downtime.

******************** STEP # 1 "ASSIGNING IP ADDRESSES" ************************

1. Select 2 servers and 1 PC.
2. Assign IP addresses and Subnet mask to both servers and PC.
3. For assigning IP addresses and Subnet mask click on the device then go to Desktop Tab and then Click on Ip configuration and then enter the respective things.
4. Also Enter the DNS Server on all the devices the one that you entered as an IP address of DNS server.



******************** STEP # 2 " MAKE A WEBSITE ON WEB SERVER" ************************

1. To make a website click on web server.
2. Go to SERVICES tab .
3. Go to HTTP .
4. Click on "ON" button for both HTTP & HTTPS.
5. Then at the last click on New File.
6. Or you can edit the already present "index.html" file at the end  by clicking on edit.
7. Then write your desire html code.
8. Then save it , if it shows the overwrite message then click yes and then cross that from the upper right corner of that tab.


******************** STEP # 3 " Implementing DNS " ************************

1. Now go to the second server and implement DNS on it.
2. To implement DNS , click on the DNS server and then go to SERVICES tab.
3. Click on DNS from the services .
4. Then Click on "ON" button to enable "DNS Service".
5. Then write random name like "www.abc.com".
6. Then write ip address of web server in Address option.
7. Then click on "Add".
8. Then click on "Save".


******************** STEP # 4 " Accessing website through PC " ************************
1. Now to access the website we made on WEB Server.
2. Click on PC & go to Desktop Tab.
3. Then click on Web Browser.
4. Write the name you write during DNS implementation like "www.abc.com" on the URL.
5. Click on "GO".
6. And you will see the content of your website!!!!!


In this setup, DNS does two main things:
 -----> It maps your domain name to your web server’s IP
------> So when someone types www.yourdomain.com, DNS tells the browser:
            “The website is hosted at the IP address 192.168.X.X” 
We don't have to remember the Ip Addresses!!!
