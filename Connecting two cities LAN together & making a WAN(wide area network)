This repository provides a comprehensive guide and configuration examples for designing, setting up, and managing a Wide Area Network (WAN).
###################### PKT FILE OF CISCO PACKET TRACER IS ATTACHED TOO IN ANOTHER REPO FOR PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION ###################

# <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< DEVICES REQUIRED >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. Two 1841 or any other routers 
2. Two switches
3. Multiple PC's or laptops
4. Serial DTE wire for connection between both routers
5. Simple wire for connecting other devices together




# <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< SETUP >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. Place both routers in the workspace and connect them with the help of SERIAL DTE cable.
2. Attach one switch with 1st router and the other switch with 2nd router.
3. Further connect PCS or laptops or other communication devices with both switches according to the switch's capacity.





# <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< CONFIGURATION OF DEVICES >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

// ROUTER CONFIGURATION:
1. Click on the router and then click on the Config button.
2. Then find the name of the wire side which is connected with the respective router (like in my case Se0/0/0).
3. Assign IP Address (like 20.0.0.1) and Subnet Mask (like 255.0.0.0).
4. Same process for the 2nd router find the name of the wire side for this router (like in my case Se0/0/1).
5.  Assign IP Address (like 20.0.0.2) and Subnet Mask (like 255.0.0.0) to the 2nd router.

                      /// This above 5 steps configuration is called serial port configuration ///

6. After that go to the Config option again and then find the name of the wire side which is connected with the switch.
7. Like in my case FastEthernet0/0 for my both routers .
8. Assign IP Address and Subnet mask in both routers respectively.


// PC's Configuration
1. Click on the PC .
2. Goto Desktop option.
3. Click on IP configuration.
4. Assign IP ADDRESS ,SUBNET MASK, DEfAULT GATEWAY(the one we written in the router (FastEthernet0/0) option.The wire with which the switch is connected).
5. Remember that the default gateway will be same for all the PCs or laptops that are connected in that particular Router#1 network.
6. And the PCs or Laptops connected in the Router#2 network will have different default gateway than the Router#1. 
7. The Router#2 network's PCs or laptops will have that one default gateway that we written in the router (FastEthernet0/0) option in this respective router.



# <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< CHECKING CONNECTION >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1.Check the connection  by sending PDU from one device to another and check whether the message is sent successfully or not.
2. You can also check the connection by pinging the devices.
3. For PING click on any device (like PC) and go to the desktop option and from there click on the COMMAND PROMPT .
4. Then write the following command there ----> ping device_IP_ADDRESS (like ping 192.168.1.10) you have to write the IP ADDRESS of other device.
5. If the reply came then your connection is successfully established.
